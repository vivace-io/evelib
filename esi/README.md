# EVELib/ESI

Why not generate from swagger?

1. I don't care for how the Swagger Go generator outputs everything.
2. Long file names are a pain for windows.

Beyond that, I admit that it makes little sense.

And, yes, it doesn't make sense to have mixed versions of the API in the same package, I'll separate it later down the road...
